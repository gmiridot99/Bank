# Bank

Practising in solidity..

Creating a simple smart contract where anyone can lock his eth (there could be the possibility to use other token updating the SC) locking them for a period of time.
In this way even if a thief break into the user's house and blackmail him/her and his family he/she can't give him the money.

Yeah, he can give him the private key, but in that case there is the #reserveOrderActivation function where who has the allowance can redirect that money to him and the thief is ... .

There is also another function thanks with the user can withdraw a little percentage (decided during the locking) ever tot period of time (decided during the locking)

Using remix should all be correct, still have to understand truffle migration and test.
